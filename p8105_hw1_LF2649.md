### Problem 0.1

The link is <https://github.com/Lin322/p8105_hw1_LF2649>.

### Problem 0.2

This “problem” focuses on correct styling for your solutions to Problems 1 and 2. We will look for:

-   meaningful variable / object names
-   readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and indentation; etc)
-   clearly-written text to explain code and results
-   a lack of superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no extra library calls; ect

Problem 1
=========

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
-   logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
-   character vector of length 10
-   factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
p1_df = tibble(
 vec_numrc = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
 vec_numrc_pos = vec_numrc > 0,
 vec_char = c("The", "character","vector","has","to","be","exactly","ten","words","here"),
 vec_factor = factor(c("A","A","B","B","C","C","C","C","C","C"))
)

p1_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 x 4
    ##    vec_numrc vec_numrc_pos vec_char  vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>         <chr>     <fct>     
    ##  1    0.545  TRUE          The       A         
    ##  2   -1.16   FALSE         character A         
    ##  3   -1.32   FALSE         vector    B         
    ##  4   -1.44   FALSE         has       B         
    ##  5   -2.06   FALSE         to        C         
    ##  6    1.25   TRUE          be        C         
    ##  7    1.09   TRUE          exactly   C         
    ##  8    0.544  TRUE          ten       C         
    ##  9    0.0494 TRUE          words     C         
    ## 10    1.17   TRUE          here      C

Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesn’t?

-   R can caculate mean for mumeric and logical data, but cannot for character and foctor data.

``` r
vec_numrc = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1)

mean(vec_numrc)
```

    ## [1] -0.4809511

``` r
vec_numrc_pos = vec_numrc > 0

mean(vec_numrc_pos)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

``` r
vec_char = c("The", "character","vector","has","to","be","exactly","ten","words","here")

mean(vec_char)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(vec_char): argument is not numeric or logical: returning
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
vec_factor = factor(c("A","A","B","B","C","C","C","C","C","C"))

mean(vec_factor)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(vec_factor): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA
